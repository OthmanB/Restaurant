# Restaurant analytical model for sales and expenses

The goal of this program is to provide a analytical model describing how much a restaurant will get as benefits, based on a parametric description of the sales and of expenses.
Note that this does not involve Machine Learning sales prediction: The sale model is a pure parametric model, for which data are required to support its underlying assumptions (choice of the distributions).
